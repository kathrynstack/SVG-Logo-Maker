# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to make a tool that generates a logo for the user, instead of going through the effor of creating one on your own.
I built this project to test my skills in Node and Javascript and to make a project that could benefit anyone wanted to make a simplistic logo.
I learned firstly what an SVG was, as well as how to use my knowledge in Node and JS to code a project that could be used by anyone to make a logo.
